🚀 **A Machine Learning-powered system to classify credit card customers as potential defaulters or non-defaulters.**  
This project utilizes **Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and Streamlit** to make predictions based on financial data.

## 📌 Features  
✔ **Predicts whether a customer will default on their credit card payments**  
✔ **Uses a trained Machine Learning model (Scikit-learn, Logistic Regression)**  
✔ **User-friendly and interactive UI with Streamlit**  
✔ **Model stored on Google Drive (auto-downloads if missing)**  
✔ **Lightweight & easy to deploy**

## 📸 Example Predictions  
| 📊 User Inputs  | 🔮 Prediction |
|----------------|--------------|
| Credit Lines: 10, Income: $5000 | ✅ No Default |
| Credit Lines: 2, Income: $1500 | ❌ Default Risk |

---

## 🏗️ How It Works  
1️⃣ **User enters financial details** (Credit lines, income, dependents, etc.)  
2️⃣ **Model processes inputs & makes a prediction**  
3️⃣ **Displays result: ✅ No Default or ❌ High Default Risk**  
4️⃣ **Automatically downloads the ML model if missing**
